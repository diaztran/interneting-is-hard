  <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
  <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

  <h2>Headings</h2>
  <p>Heading define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

  <h2>Lists</h2>

  <p>This is how you make an ordered list:</p>

  <!--<ul> elements should only contain <li> elements-->
  <ul>
    <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
    <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
    <li>They don't need to be in particular order</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is how you make an ordered list:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
    <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
    <li>Also not how the numbers increment on their own</li>
    <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

  <p><em>Sometime</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word of phrase.</p>

  <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importace of a word or phrase</p>

  <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

  <p><strong><em>And shout again!</em></strong></p>

  <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

  <p>Those who fall behind, get left behind!</p>
